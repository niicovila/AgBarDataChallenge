# AgBarDataChallenge
Development of an anomaly-detection hierarchical deep learning model, trained for anomaly detection in water pipeline systems.

Features: 
 - Anomaly detection
 - Consumption pattern recognition
 - Consumption Prediction
 - Webapp visualization

Key parts of our meta-model: 
 - Time Series Analysis 
 - Transformer Anomaly Detection
 - LSTM
 - Prophet
